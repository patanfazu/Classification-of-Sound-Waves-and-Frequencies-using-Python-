# Classification-of-Sound-Waves-and-Frequencies-using-Python-
## Classify certain sound waves according to their existing genres and varieties using K nearest neighbors Algorithm.
### Dataset for this project collected from Music Analysis, Retrieval and Synthesis for Audio Signals (MARSYAS) website, Data Set used was GTZAN Genre Collection this dataset consists of 1000 audio files of 10 different genres, each file is 30 seconds long these files are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in format
We have taken 10 wav format files
from UC Irvine Machine Learning
Repository these 10 files belongs to
different genres, these files are used
to test the model we tested the model
with an approximate accuracy of
0.7015384615384616 the 10 wav
files used for model testing or
predicting are:
1. BabyElephantWalk60.wav
2. CatinaBand3.wav
3. CatinaBand60.wav

4. Fanfare60.wav
5. gettysburg.wav
6. gettysburg10.wav
7. PinkPanther30.wav
8. preamble.wav
9. sample_wav.wav
10. 10.StarWars60.wav

Music assumes a significant part in
everybody's everyday life and is
likewise utilized for a wide scope of
destinations. The difficulty we have
looked at, all things considered, is we
discover trouble in arranging the
music type. In these days there was
an expanded number and size of
music in the current years. We have
focused on this music genre because
in order to get summarization of
common patterns and features
shared by different songs and The
development of tools should be
accurate for the music information
retrieval.

People don't generally have sound
music hypothetical establishments,
for example - Indian types are
geologically characterized, Baroque is
old style music type dependent on
time span. Notwithstanding the
absence of a standard measure for

characterizing genre, the
arrangement of music dependent on
classes is one of the broadest and
most generally utilized. Classification
normally expects high weight in
music recommender frameworks.
For the most part, to bunch all the
music dependent on the class for
example a well known playlist(most
played melodies like the ones given),
rhythms(instrumental), quick
beats(pop music), and moderate
songs(Melodies). There are
distinctive programming procedures
utilized for grouping music types,
some of them are MIR(Music
Information Retrieval), Machine
learning strategies to develop skills ,
CNN(Convolution Neural Network).
To get more productivity our group
has utilized a GTZAN dataset to come
up with our own algorithm. Due to
the evolution of music it’s important
to have Genre Classification.
